                        <p>This is just filler text feel free to replace it!<br /><br />Growing up in the late 90′s, like a lot of kids, I fell in love with the Final Fantasy series through the brilliantly marketed Final Fantasy VII. Writing 700 words on why I liked attunements is pretty useless and overindulgent in the larger picture of things. Scanning the home system afresh this time finds a second new signature, this one resolving to be another wormhole. That run, we were going to kill Lich King 25 on Heroic mode. This year LOTRO has a brand new festival that falls between the Spring and Summer festivals called the Farmer’s Faire. </p>
